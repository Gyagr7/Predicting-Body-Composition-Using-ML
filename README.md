This repository accompanies our paper on **graph-based and supervised learning methods for body-composition prediction** from **3D optical imaging–derived features**. We study a **p-Laplacian semi-supervised regression** framework that builds a participant similarity graph and leverages both labeled and unlabeled data through p-Laplacian regularization, and we benchmark it against widely used supervised baselines including **XGBoost, neural networks, random forests, polynomial regression, SVR, and LSSVR**. The codebase is organized for reproducible experimentation—data preprocessing, model training, cross-validation, metric computation, and result generation—so the main comparisons and performance summaries from the manuscript can be reproduced.

Although the experiments in the paper are run on our study dataset, the pipeline is **designed to be reusable**: you can point the scripts to your own CSV (or feature matrix), specify the target variables and any columns to exclude, and run the same training/evaluation workflow to benchmark these methods on **your own data**.
